# Next Basic Template

This is the basic template I start my next projects with. Mostly just personal styling / components I always find myself building.

## How to create

- Copy all of the folders and files in the root `homepage-2024` directory to a new directory.
  - Exclude `.next` and `node_modules`

- Change all instances of `homepage-2024` to the name of the new project.

- Run `npm install` to install packages.
