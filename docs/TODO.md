# TODO

- Get better images for projects
  - Maybe bigger images
  - Maybe gifs
  - Maybe work on scrolling
- Change icons for contact page to be the same color

- Build javascript logic to add CSS variables that allow the FIXED_FRAME component to scale and translate itself as necessary
  - Might need to move the LOGO componenet into the same place as the content / view, then transform the view
  
- Add styles that make the FIXED_FRAME look like a game-guy
