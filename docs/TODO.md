# TODO

Change chevron direction to left/right in short view in controls
Change frame / theme color controls. Especially on mobile. Maybe sliders?
Figure out why the CLOSE button in modal context is escaping the content div... shouldn't a FIXED element be bound by a RELATIVE one?
Need to rewrite my project descriptions
  - Add double new-lines to the ones that have single
  - Rewrite Japanese, to ます形. Also get someone to proofread.
