# TODO

- Get better images for projects
  - Maybe bigger images
  - Maybe gifs
  - Maybe work on scrolling
- Change icons for contact page to be the same color

- Figure out the glitch with project card images
  - It seems to be because the outerDivRef is not ready, it is giving undefined for width and height to the child
